# Immersive Sea Level Projections 🌊🌍

An immersive VR application that visualizes future sea-level rise in coastal cities using 3D geospatial data and climate projections. Built with **Unity**, **Cesium**, and **XR**, the project allows users to *walk or fly* through flooded cities to better understand the spatial and human impact of climate change.


## 🎯 Project Goal

Traditional 2D maps and charts often fail to convey the real-world impact of sea-level rise. This project leverages **3D visualization and Virtual Reality** to:

- Improve awareness of future coastal flooding  
- Enable embodied exploration of affected cities  
- Support education and decision-making in climate resilience planning  

## ✨ Features

* Cesium-powered global 3D terrain and buildings
* Sea level projection in VR 
* Interactive city and year selection
* Fly and walk navigation modes
* Charts for getting insights from the data
## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Requirements

### Hardware
- **Meta Quest 3**
### Software
- **Unity 6000.3.0f1**
- **Cesium for Unity**
- **XCharts**


## 🌐 Cesium Account Requirement (Important)

⚠️ **This project will not work without a Cesium account and a valid Cesium ion connection.**

To render 3D terrain and buildings, Cesium for Unity requires access to **Cesium ion**.
